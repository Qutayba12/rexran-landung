# Rexran Master Plan: From Zero to Global Dominance

## 1. The Vision & Mission
To build the world's most stable, scalable, and developer-centric AI web orchestration ecosystem. Rexran aims to replace manual coding cycles for SaaS founders and agencies, providing full ownership and enterprise-grade quality.

## 2. Core Strategic Pillars
- **Zero-Compromise Quality:** Production-ready Next.js 15+ by default.
- **Sovereign Ownership:** No vendor lock-in. Full code and data control.
- **RTL/Arabic Dominance:** The first AI builder to treat Arabic as a first-class citizen.
- **Multi-Agent Stability:** Specialized AI roles to prevent code regressions.

## 3. 90-Day Execution Plan (Rexran v1.0 - The Beachhead)

### Days 1–30: Core Foundation & Infrastructure
**Goal:** Establish the technical identity and basic project generation flow.
- **Stack Lockdown:** Next.js 15 (App Router), Tailwind 4, Drizzle + Postgres, Node Edge Runtime.
- **The "Elite SaaS Template":**
    - Auth: Clerk integration.
    - Billing: Stripe/LemonSqueezy ready.
    - UI: Pro RTL Dashboard (Sidebar, Tables, Basic Charts).
- **Discovery Engine (v0):** Prompt handling + Discovery questions (Brand, Roles, Logic) -> JSON Spec.
- **GitHub Sync (v0):** Automated project creation, renaming, and initial push via script.
- **Rexran CLI Lite:** Commands: `rex init`, `rex link`, `rex deploy`.

### Days 31–60: Usability & Real-World Generation
**Goal:** Enable founders to go from Prompt to a working, deployed SaaS.
- **"SaaS-in-a-Box" Reality:** Ensure a user can log in, answer discovery, and get a deployed Next.js app with working Auth and Billing.
- **Code Generators:** Build specialized generators for DB Schema (Drizzle), React Pages/Routes, and CRUD API routes.
- **Regression Memory (v0.1):** Save project specs; compare before new generations to prevent breaking changes.
- **Observability (v0):** Internal dashboard for logs (generation time, errors) and user metrics.
- **Beta Testing:** Onboard 5-10 users (Founders & Arabic Agencies). Aim for 2 successful live deployments.

### Days 61–90: Polish, Self-Healing & Launch
**Goal:** Refine the experience and officially launch Rexran v1.0.
- **The Face of Rexran:** Launch high-conversion Landing Page + User Dashboard (Project status: Draft, Generated, Deployed).
- **Stability & Quality:**
    - **Self-Healing (v0.1):** Auto-analyze build logs on failure and attempt auto-fixes.
    - **Performance:** Ensure templates score >90 on Lighthouse.
- **GTM (Go-To-Market):** Launch on X (Twitter) and Arabic developer communities.
- **Official v1.0 Release:** Finalized feature set, Changelog, and Public Roadmap.
